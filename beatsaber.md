<a href="http://beatsaber.com/" target="_blank">BeatSaber</a>, released in May 2018, is like a mix of guitar hero and fruit ninja. It presents the player with a stream of approaching blocks in sync with the song's beats and notes. The player uses VR motion controllers to slash these blocks while avoiding obstacles and bombs. Though very popular on VR platforms, the game itself has a limited choice of playable songs, so hardcore players have resorted to manually adding and annotating custom songs. In this project, OxAI members will create an AI that automatically generates levels of arbitrary difficulty given any input song. To do so, we will investigate and evaluate different level representations and multiple machine learning models.
